ride the train to the end of the line
you don't have a ticket, but in each car you visit there is a person with a ticket to the next stop
they're going with some kind of goal, but if you can give them what they want they don't have to take the train, and will give you their ticket

# possible motives

4 horsemen:
famine: I'm looking for a mean
conquest: I'm looking for love
war: I'm looking for a fight
death

7 sins
gluttony: I'm looking for my next meal (give him a meal)
lust: I'm looking for love in the city (find his love on the train)
greed: I'm off to seek my fortune (win him a poker game)
wrath: I'm seeking revenge
sloth:
envy
pride

each time you're looking to satisfy Ulysses's motive, and take his ticket (and each time he ends up getting kicked off the train)
each train car has the same character, who mysteriously is back on the train, but it's his first time meeting you
  as a bonus, get to reuse this character sprite, and player immediately knows who to talk to

inferno
1. limbo: sneak onto the cargo car
2. lust: find his love (he leaves willingly)
3. gluttony: find his next meal (guard says "you can't take food out of the dining cart", kicks him off)
4. greed: give him a winning poker hand (he's kicked off by other players for cheating)
5. wrath: get his rival kicked off the train (he jumps off after him)
6. heresy: talk to him until he thinks he's on the wrong train
7. violence: start a fight and take a ticket (everyone else is kicked off)
8. fraud: create a fake ticket
9. treachery: only the conductor is there, he talks to you, 
   for betraying your friend Ulysses he says "no, this is your stop, you'll have to wait for the next train"
if you waited in limbo long enough, you would have eventually made it to your destination anyways
